            <div id="secondary">
                <h4>Getting Back to Basics</h4>
                <p>Wizarding Challenges are a unique type of gameplay where you can team up with wizards from around the world to engage in combat with a variety of Foes. To enter a Wizarding Challenge, tap on a Fortress and use a Runestone to join. If you find yourself without any Fortresses nearby, the Knight Bus is always available for players level 7 and above to instantly whisk you away to a Fortress at Hogwarts Castle, allowing you to play from the comfort of home.</p>
                <p>For those victorious in combat, you’ll be rewarded with a variety of items depending on the difficulty of the challenge. Rewards can include unique Foundables only found in Wizarding Challenges, Scrolls, Spell Books, Wizard XP and Challenge XP, which helps you get stronger in Wizarding Challenges.</p>
                <h4>The Pros of Professionalism</h4>
                <p>Before jumping into the fray, you’ll want to make sure you choose a wizarding Profession—Auror, Magizoologist or Professor. Each Profession specializes in different areas: Aurors are adept at dishing out serious damage with powerful offensive spells, Magizoologists are masters of defense and supporting their allies and Professors are experts in balance and versatility, with spells for any situation.</p>
                <p>Each Profession has its own specific skills that you can learn over time by using the Scrolls, Spell Books and Restricted Section Books that you’ve been collecting. Spend some time learning some of your Profession’s skills before entering into combat and you’ll be well on your way to toppling even the most formidable Foes!</p>
